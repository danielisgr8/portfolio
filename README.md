# Portfolio
A project to host my e-portfolio.

A slew of my other applications have been added to this project as submodules. Each application is run on a separate port and reached through reverse proxying.

## Building
Each submodule has its own instructions for building, which can be found in each of their READMEs.

Building the client of this respository itself (which is essentially just the homepage) can be done with the npm script "build": `npm run build`.
